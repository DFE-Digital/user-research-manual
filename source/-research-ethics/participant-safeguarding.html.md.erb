# What safeguarding is in research

Safeguarding is the protection of a person’s health, wellbeing, and right to live in safety, free from harm, abuse and neglect (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).  

Researchers are required to pass participant information on where they are aware of:

- a risk of harm to a child or vulnerable person
- an immediate, serious risk to the participant’s safety
-	an immediate, serious risk to the safety of others.

As researchers, we must safeguard research participants, themselves and anyone else involved in the research. We can do this by ensuring our research is conducted in a safe, inclusive and protective environment  preparing our research carefully and being ready to act on a safeguarding concern. 

There are 3 main types of safeguarding risks in research that you should consider in your planning and prepare to manage in your research:

1. The risk of causing the participant and others harm in research settings
For example: if a participant is asked to discuss a traumatic topic and becomes upset

2. The risk of harm being disclosed or identified in research settings
For example: if a young child reveals that they are left home alone for long periods of time
For example: you overhear aggressive and abusive language towards your participant on a remote interview

3. Direct risks posed by health conditions.
For example: exposing participants to an increased chance of catching COVID-1

## Prepare for the research

###Understand the risks associated with the groups you are researching with

Participants present differing degrees of potential risk and harm, depending on personal circumstances, characteristics and backgrounds. There may be occasions when you do research with vulnerable participants that require extra care.  Vulnerability in research can be defined in different ways, such as age, disability or potential marginalisation <a href="https://www.ukri.org/about-us/policies-standards-and-data/good-research-resource-hub/preventing-harm-in-research/>(UKRI).</a>
- Speak to professionals who are familiar with your user group, especially vulnerable users (for instance, a SEN teacher). This might be an internal team in DfE or an SME. Read any relevant documents they signpost you to before your research to see if there is anything you should avoid in your research

### Standard practice materials will help inform your participants on the topics of your research and how you handle their data

You can find <a href="https://user-research.education.gov.uk/-tools-and-templates/templates.html#content">templates in the templates, examples and resources library.</a>
- Information sheets and privacy notices: Make the subject matter and activities research involved in participation clear. You should also explain to the participant what data you will be collecting and how it will be stored. Include information about the participants data protection rights and the steps you take as a researcher to protect their data. Be clear that it is a researcher's professional obligation to report safeguarding concerns.
- Informed consent forms: you must obtain <a href="https://user-research.education.gov.uk/-research-ethics/informed-consent.html"> informed consent</a> from participants ahead of conducting research.
- If these documents are for young people, see this guidance on <a href="https://user-research.education.gov.uk/-research-ethics/children-young-people.html"> doing research with children.</a> You might need to use different and simplified terminology to ensure all of the terms related to confidentiality and consent are fully understood by the child and their gatekeeper - see examples in <a href="https://user-research.education.gov.uk/-research-ethics/informed-consent.html#case-studies-and-advice-for-different-approaches-to-consent">Informed Consent.</a>
  
### Be empathetic to each user and consider how your research might be linked to the potential for harm 
  
It is important to be aware of what you are asking your participants to discuss, in what circumstances, and who will be present. 

- Stick to two observers maximum (unless observers are in a separate observation room). Remember you can playback your key findings to the team, as well as recordings if the participant has provided consent
- Consider the format or location of your research – some topics might not be appropriate to discuss in shared spaces, such as focus groups or pop-up research 
- Your research might include individuals from marginalised groups or users that are traditionally classed as ‘hard to reach.’ An inclusive sample and research approach is necessary but remember that some topics of conversation might cause upset to some participants but not cause harm to others. Be wary of signs that your participant is upset, for instance they might avoid the question or become agitated. Be ready to take steps to minimise harm to the participant, such as rephrasing the question, taking breaks, or reiterating that they do not have to answer questions if they do not want to. Full guidance covering inclusivity in research will be available soon

### Learn the right protocols to follow in the case of a safeguarding concern

It is important you know the right protocols to follow ahead of your research, in the case that you need to escalate a safeguarding concern.
  
-	Familiarise yourself with the contact details of the appropriate safeguarding lead for your users. Preparing this ahead of research will help you act as quickly as necessary, without searching for guidance or contact details once you are aware of the risk.

- Create a risk log in a restricted location to record risks you identify as your fieldwork progresses. If you record a risk that needs to be escalated for safeguarding reasons, this log will be helpful evidence if you have to take action.

| __A child at school:__ | __A vulnerable individual in social care:__ |
|---------------|---------------|
| Find the contact details of the safeguarding lead at their school before you do the research | Find the contact details of the safeguarding lead at their local authority|
| If you have identified a high likelihood of a safeguarding risk, ask these individuals to send you any guidance on how and when to contact them. You may want to familiarise yourself with the specific protocols of that institution, for instance <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1101454/Keeping_children_safe_in_education_2022.pdf">Keeping Children Safe in Education.</a> |
