# Get advice about research ethics

For advice on ethical issues related to user research, you can ask the <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/C03MMLGDC4B" target="_blank">Ethics advisory group on Slack (#ethicsadvisorygroup) (opens in a new window)</a>. They aim to reply to your questions within 3 working days.

This channel is run by volunteers from our <a href="/-about-ur-at-dfe/working-groups-and-interest-groups.html">ethics working group</a>.
