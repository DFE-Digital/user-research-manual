# Standards and guidance


As a community of practice, and working with other teams in the Department, we have developed ethical and safeguarding standards to make sure our research is respectful and does not cause harm to our users, our teams, and ourselves.

Working to consistent principles, guidelines and standards enables us to deliver joined-up, effective, targeted and trusted research that helps our teams deliver better services to our users.

As a user researcher at DfE, you should always follow the guidance set out in these standards. You should also get feedback on your research plans, and after your research is complete.

The list of standaards isn't exhaustive, and we may add to it or improve upon it, so it is important that you continue to check for any modifications or updates frequently.
