# DfE accessibility support for services

## DfE Accessibility team

The DfE accessibility team only support some of DfE's services and systems directly but they'll be able to help you with general advice on how to make your service more accessible.

If you're looking for support or want to find out if the team can help you, email the business engagement and accessibility team at accessibility.support@education.gov.uk.

The team can give you advice about:

* how to make your service more accessible
* current legislation and how you can meet it to make sure your service is compliant
* checking your service accessibility statement before publication
* what you need to do if your service needs an accessibility assurance audit


## Accessibility Community

You can [sign up to Slack](https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/signup) and join the DfE workspace to communicate and share ideas. Look at #accessibility channel, where the accessibility team share ideas, knowledge and issues around access to DfE services.


## Share knowledge and experiences

The team want to get to a point where we're sharing knowledge and experiences across government, setting up partnerships to improve accessibility together. To get to that point, we've got a lot to learn.

The team want to hear your feedback around accessibility. If you want to share ideas about how we can improve access to DfE services and better support you, email the business engagement and accessibility team at accessibility.support@education.gov.uk.
