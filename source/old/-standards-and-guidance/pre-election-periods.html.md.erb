# Pre-election periods

<div class="dfeuk-do-dont-list"><h3 class="dfeuk-do-dont-list__label">About the term "purdah" </h3>

<p>The term 'purdah' is often used unofficially to describe the period immediately before an election or referendum when there are restrictions on the activity of civil servants. 
<p>
Although you may still hear the word 'purdah' used across the Civil Service, due to <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/purdah" target=_blank>the connotations of the word</a>, we prefer to use the term 'pre-election period'.
</div>

During pre-election periods there are some things that government departments and civil servants should avoid doing or be careful doing. 

Although The Civil Service Code of Conduct permanently binds Civil Servants, the code's core values should be observed even more closely during pre-election periods. These are: 

<li>integrity - putting the obligations of public service above your interests
<li>honesty - being truthful and open
<li>objectivity - basing your advice and decisions on rigorous analysis of the evidence
<li>impartiality - acting solely according to the merits of the case and serving equally well governments of different political persuasions.

## Researching in pre-election periods

Typically, most user research activities can continue in pre-election periods as user research supports service delivery against a defined policy. However, there are some subjects and methods that researchers should avoid.

User researchers working on more exploratory types of research should be particularly cautious in their research approach. For example, you may be working on a policy or service that has not been formally announced to the public or could be considered more contentious in the run-up to an election.

During a pre-election period, you can:

<li>recruit members of the public through recruitment agencies, as long as initial adverts and screeners do not mention or imply that the research is for a government service
<li>invite participants from existing user research panels - this is especially helpful for any sensitive research 
<li>use internal channels to recruit colleagues for user research on internal aspects of services.

</div>
Although the Civil Service code should always be applied when carrying out research on behalf of the department, during a pre-election period, you should especially:

<li>keep contact with users limited to operational communications only (e.g. for recruitment purposes or to provide updates on research session details)
<li>continue to be mindful of how you use social media - 'likes' on social media can be seen as direct endorsements, and any posts or comments made are also open to public scrutiny.
<li>be careful about what you discuss with users during research sessions - steer away from any political discussion or commentary. If users express a political opinion, remain neutral and professional and explain you are unable to comment if you are invited to

## Further guidance

As long as your research is not contentious and cannot possibly influence the outcome of an election, it's generally safe to proceed during a pre-election period. However, itâ€™s advisable to err on the side of caution and to sense-check your research with your team. 

If you are unsure whether your research is 'safe', raise a project risk with your service's Delivery Manager, or speak to a Lead User Researcher for advice on how you can manage or mitigate risk. Specific workarounds may work for your service, meaning research can go ahead, e.g. by using proxy participants and testing non-politically sensitive parts of the service.

In some instances, it may be necessary to get an agreement to proceed with the Senior Responsible Officer (SRO) or other Deputy Director who has accountability for your service. The Lead User Researchers can advise whether this is necessary, and your Delivery Manager can arrange this.
