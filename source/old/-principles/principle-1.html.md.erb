# Principle 1: <br>We tell all of our users’ stories

This principle is about **representing every user, and bringing them to the heart of DfE’s work**.

It means that when we research, we include a broad range of users to make sure we have a deep and contextual understanding of all our users and their needs, using their own words to tell their stories.

As a user researcher at DfE, you’ll know you’re successfully doing this because:

- You recruit users diversely and inclusively
- You are able to fluently talk about your users, the problems they face, and how your service area or project fits into wider aspects of their lives
- You use a range of methods to describe and visualise your users and their needs
- You can demonstrate how user needs are reflected in your team’s design decisions
- You are able to challenge decisions where users' needs are not being prioritised

Right now, we help you to do this by giving you:

- Access to a specialist participant recruitment supplier, and support and guidance to use them
- Access to incentives
- Self-recruitment guidance and standards
- A library of example research methods and outputs

In the future (see our profession roadmap), we’ll also give you:

- Access to a range of specialist participant recruitment suppliers
- An incentives policy, describing when we can and can’t use incentives
- Recruitment specialists working in each portfolio
- Simpler ways to increase inclusivity of hard-to-reach user groups in our research
- Our own participant panel to recruit from
