    <p>We're developing a framework of professional standards for user research, and a single department-wide peer review and assurance process for user research. See our <a href="/-about-ur-at-dfe/developing-ur-profession.html">profession roadmap</a>.</p>
    <p>Until then, use the advice below.</p>
    </blockquote>
      <p>It's important that you know that you are doing a good job, and that your team and stakeholders can be confident that our work meets and exceeds standards</a>. 
      <p>As well as meeting the service standard, your research must always be <strong>ethical</strong>, <strong>legal</strong> and <strong>safe</strong>. Use the standards in this website where they have already been developed. Until then, you should aim to meet other existing industry standards, like those of the <a href="https://www.mrs.org.uk/">Market Research Society</a>.
