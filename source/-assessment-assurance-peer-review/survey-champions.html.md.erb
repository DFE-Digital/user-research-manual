    <p>We're rethinking how to support and assure survey design, and will publish new guidance soon (<a href="/-about-ur-at-dfe/developing-ur-profession.html">see our profession roadmap</a>).</p>
    <p>Until then, use the advice below.</p>

<%= warning_text("Publishing a survey to DfE users without the correct assurance could get you in trouble")%>

If you are planning a survey, then you may need to get support in designing the survey, it may need to use a specific survey software, and you may need to get it approved by DfE's Subsidiary Research Board.

This is generally the case if your survey is quantitative and looking for statistically significant data. Qualitative surveys typically don't need this oversight and can use other software: however, it is always best practise to speak to a survey champion to check.

The survey champions network is led by our colleagues in the government social research profession, and some user researchers are trained as survey champions. The user researcher group is coordinated by Will Finn - <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/team/U0360NUT6PJ" target="_blank">contact Will in DfE Slack to access them</a>.
