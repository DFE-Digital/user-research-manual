# Using social media for user research

Social media has proven an invaluable tool in user research, helping us to gather insight into users and their environments, proving to be a powerful source for [desk research](/desk-research). 

As user researchers, we can learn a lot from how people interact and engage through social media. We can see the experiences of users “in the moment” and (to an extent) in context, without needing to bring users into a research setting. In this sense, the data social media can provide is - in many ways - unfiltered, unaffected by research power dynamics, and accessible, with users sharing their experiences and emotions authentically, in their own words and in their own context.

Social media is a helpful tool to use in combination with other tools and methods available to us as user researchers.

## Uses of social media in user research

As a user researcher, you can use social media to: 

<li>gather insight on groups and users you are interested in researching with, as secondary data - especially during a discovery or requirements-gathering phase of research
<li>track search terms and analytics data relating to your research subject, identify the language and sentiment expressed by users 
<li>share quotes and insights with your wider team to help contextualise users’ experiences of your service/product
<li>monitor how a situation or scenario changes over time (for example, trending topics)
<li>understand potential pain points and experiences of users, based on the information they choose to share publicly
<li>get quick and free insight into your users

Although <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/using-social-media-user-research/" target=_blank>we can learn a lot from accessing publicly available information and sentiments on social media</a>, as user researchers in the Department for Education, we do not recruit via social media. This is in order to protect the wellbeing of researchers and to protect the department’s reputation. 

Recruiting via social media platforms can leave individual researchers open to negative backlash and ethical challenge and members of the public can feel uncomfortable if researchers recruit through social media groups or by directly approaching them. Directly approaching one group or individual over another on social media could be seen as favouritism or a lack of impartiality, especially in research where [incentives](/incentives.html) are being used. 

Similarly, by using social media as a recruitment channel, we may be more prone to recruiting those who have a larger presence, following or influence online which can lead to bias and a lack of consideration around diverse and inclusive recruitment (for example, potentially excluding those users who predominantly or exclusively use offline parts of a service). 

Although social media is not a tool we use for recruitment in the department, there are other approved methods of [participant recruitment](/participant-recruitment.html) which can help you to find the users you need to research with.

As well as considerations around social media in user research, as civil servants we are expected to observe the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-media-guidance-for-civil-servants/social-media-guidance-for-civil-servants#the-case-for-social-media" target=_blank>Cabinet Office’s social media guidance</a> at all times - both inside and outside of work, as well as following <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-media-guidance-for-civil-servants" target=_blank>the department’s social media guidance</a> and <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/it-acceptable-use-of-it.aspx#social-media" target=_blank>acceptable use of IT policy</a>.

If your team is using social media as part of their communications strategy, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/social-media-playbook" target=_blank>GDS social media playbook</a> outlines ways of getting the most out of social media in our work as civil servants.
