You can generally incentivise users to take part in your user research, although you shouold always ensure that it is appropriate to do so .

We are writing full standards and guidance around incetives usage (<a href="/-about-ur-at-dfe/developing-ur-profession.html">See our profession roadmap</a>). In the meantime, take the following into account:

- You should always consider value for money. You must enusre you are spending taxpayers' money appropriately and responsibly
- If you can attract participants without incentivising, then you should do. Incentives shouldn't be your default option

## Purchasing incentives

You can <a href="using-a-commercial-recruitment-agency.html">purchase incentives from our recruitment supplier</a>.

You can also purchase incentives through your own business area, although if you do this you will need to manage the security and data security of this process: we therefore don't recommend it.
