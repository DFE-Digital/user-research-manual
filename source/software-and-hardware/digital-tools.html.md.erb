# Digital tools

There are a range of tools you will need when conducting user research. <p>

The Technology Directorate provides and supports DfE’s approved software and hardware.<p>

Staff with access to our intranet can use the <a href="https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal" target=_blank> Service Portal</a> to request access to devices like laptops and smartphones, as well as productivity tools, like Office 365 and Skype for Business. Other software is also available to download through the Software Centre, found on your DfE device.<p>

User researchers can also <a href="/power-devices/"> request a power device</a> if there is a business need for an upgrade to a more powerful device than the standard DfE Windows devices. <p>

If you are a contractor who needs a DfE device, you will need to ask a permanent member of staff (Grade 7 or above) within your team to request one for you. 

<p>If you have your own device which meets the requirements set out by IT’s policy, you can enrol onto the ‘Bring Your Own Device’ (BYOD) service. A permanent (Civil Servant) member of your team will need to complete a new starter request via the DfE Service Portal, noting that you wish to enrol onto BYOD. 

## Approved tools

The Transformation and Digital Directorate provides central licensing and support for certain additional tools where there is a business need. The <a href="https://sites.google.com/digital.education.gov.uk/digitaltools/home?authuser=0">Digital Tools Support team</a> helps delivery teams with their tooling needs. 

The Digital Tools Support team are in the process of assuring what tools are provided as part of the central toolkit for digital delivery teams. This may mean that new tools become available and existing tools are removed from use. Visit the team’s Wiki for <a href="https://sites.google.com/digital.education.gov.uk/digitaltools/tools?authuser=0" target=_blank>the most up to date list of approved tools in the department</a>.

<a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/fw/SitePages/Tools-%26-Resources.aspx" target=_blank>Accessibility software and hardware supported by DfE</a> is also available for users with an <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00043/SitePages/Workplace-Adjustments.aspx" target=_blank>IT Workplace Adjustment</a>, as well as a range of <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00043/SitePages/Assistive-Software.aspx" target=_blank>assistive software</a>. Digital and Technology will also fund training for all new users of assistive software.

## Accessing and requesting tools

In order to <a href="https://sites.google.com/digital.education.gov.uk/digitaltools/request-forms?authuser=0" target=_blank>request an approved digital tool via the Digital Tools Support team</a> you will need:
<ul>
<li>approval from your finance team
<li>contact details of your Finance Business Partner
<li>the name of your budget holder Deputy Director
<li>your cost code
<li>the name(s) of people needing access to the tool
<li>to <a href="https://sites.google.com/digital.education.gov.uk/digitaltools/request-forms?authuser=0" target=_blank>complete the relevant form</a></ul><p>

﻿The team will help you access an existing licence or set up a new licence for these tools.﻿

You can also contact them if a tool you need to use is not available, or if you already have access to digital tools and have questions.

Review the usage policy for digital tools, or <a href="ddat.businesspartners@education.gov.uk" target=_blank>email your DDaT Business Partner</a> to discuss your requirements. Note that needs, rather than preferences, will be prioritised. Decisions about access to tools will be made on a case-by-case basis.﻿

There may be a cost involved with using these tools in your team, which your business area will need to justify and pay for.
