# Principle 4: <br>We are team players, agile and collaborative

This principle is about **our ways of working in our teams, programmes and portfolios.**

It means approaching UR as a team sport, and giving clear expectations about what our research is intended to deliver. We work in an agile way, continuously researching and building up insight over time, and adjusting our plans based on the insight we gather. We don’t repeat work if it has already been done, and we join up with user researchers in related teams to maximise our insight. We always understand the strategic direction and mission of our area of work, the policy around it, and how our research ultimately contributes to the Department's objectives.

As a user researcher at DfE, you’ll know you’re successfully doing this because:

- People in your team can clearly articulate what your role is, and how you work
- People from across team and stakeholders observe research and get involved in your activities like planning and analysis
- Your team understands agile user research, and has adopted ways of working that enable it to happen
- You actively seek feedback from your team on your ways of working
- You adjust your research plans based on the insight you gather
- You always check for similar research that has been conducted in the past
- You join up your insight with other user researchers in your programme area, and those outside your programme with similar users
- You can clearly articulate the policy goal that informs your team’s service or project, and are clear on how your research fits into this

Right now, we help you to do this by giving you:

- Our department-wide research and evidence library
- A list of all DfE user researchers, and the projects they are working on

In the future (see our profession roadmap), we’ll also give you:

- Playbooks and guidance on working in teams and with other professions
- Example ways of working and team planning approaches for user research
- Standard statements of work for working with contractors
