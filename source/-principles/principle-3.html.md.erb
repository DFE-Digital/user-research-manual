# Principle 3: <br>Our research is high quality, safe and ethical

This principle is about **our methods and professional standards.**

It means that our work always meets ethical and data protection standards, and we always consider the impact of our research on our users, our teams, and on ourselves. We are experts in the methods we regularly use, as well as experimenting with new and innovative methods, approaches, and ways of working.

As a user researcher at DfE, you’ll know you’re successfully doing this because:

- Your user research meets the Service Standard (even if your project isn’t assessed)
- You have a clear understanding of the legal, moral and safety implications of your research and work within our standards, guidelines and departmental policies
- You always manage your participant data in a way that meets our standards
- You recognise the impact your research may have on your wellbeing, and look after yourself
- You understand where and when to apply different research methods, approaches and ways of working
- You are happy to try new and different methods, approaches and ways of working
- You actively seek constructive feedback on your practice from your peers and colleagues
- You are open to feedback from research participants and use this to improve your practice

Right now, we help you to do this by giving you:

- Guidance, standards, frameworks and tools to deliver:
- Ethical research
- Management of personal data that is ethical and legal under GDPR
- Safe research - for participants, your team, and you
- Access to specialist software

In the future (see our profession roadmap), we’ll also give you:

- Access to a full range of specialist software, tools and services
- Recommended ways of working across different types of project and phase
- Playbooks to help you work productively with different professions
