			<p><strong class="govuk-tag">Beta</strong> This principle is about <strong>ensuring we and our teams always meet high professional standards for user research.</strong></p>
            <p>It means that we are experts in the methods we regularly use, as well as experimenting with new and innovative methods, approaches, and ways of working. Our work always meets ethical and data protection standards, and we always consider the impact of our research on our users, our teams, and on ourselves.</p>

## How you know you're doing it

As a user researcher at DfE, you’ll know you’re successfully doing this because:

- Your user research meets the Service Standard (even if your project isn’t assessed)
- You use a range of research methods and approaches, and understand where and when to apply them
- You have a clear understanding of the legal, ethical and safety risks and implications of your research, and always work within our standards and guidelines
- You look after your own and your team's wellbeing, and plan how to keep physically and mentally safe throughout your research
- You are alert to any risks, burdens or stresses that your research may present to your users, and always plan how to avoid or mitigate them
- You always manage your participant data in a UK GDPR-compliant way
