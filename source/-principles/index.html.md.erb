      <p>As a user researcher at Department for Education, you should always follow these principles.</p>
      <p>Along with our professional standards and (for civil servants) our capability framework, both of which are coming in 2023, these principles help you know what 'good' looks like when delivering your work, and help you find the support and guidance you need in order to do it.</p>
      <p>This will help us do joined-up, effective, targeted and trusted user research, helping our teams deliver better services that lead to better outcomes for our users.</p>
      <blockquote>
