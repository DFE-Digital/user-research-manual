			<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Principle 1: <br>We include all of our users, and bring them to the heart of the department's work</h1>
			<p>This principle is about <strong>researching in a way that is inclusive of all our users, and ensuring our teams understand them and their needs.</strong></p>
            <p>It means that when we research, we include a broad range of users to make sure we have a deep and contextual understanding of all our users and their needs, using their own words to tell the right stories.</p>

## How you know you're doing it

As a user researcher at DfE, you’ll know you’re successfully doing this because:

- You recruit users diversely and inclusively, thinking about how to fully represent your service users across your research
- You are able to fluently talk about your users, the problems they face, and how your service area or project fits into wider aspects of their lives
- You understand how being a member of a minority or excluded group may impact a user's experiences of DfE and their needs of your service
- You know the population sizes of different groups of users of your service, and can demonstrate how your user research complements this data
- You have researched with users with disabilities, and users of assistive technology
- You are open to feedback from research participants, and use this to improve your practice
