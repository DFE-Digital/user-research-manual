# Principle 5: <br>We support each other, develop ourselves, and advocate for UR

This principle is about **learning and developing as individuals, and together as one DfE UR community.**

It means that we come together as a community of practice, to share and learn from each others’ knowledge and experience, and we always find time to help and support each other. We work with our colleagues to develop DfE’s user research maturity and capability. We always work in the open and share our findings widely, talking about our methods, ways of working, and what we have tried and learned. We are aware of our own knowledge and skill levels, and are always looking for opportunities to upskill and learn more about our practice.

As a user researcher at DfE, you’ll know you’re successfully doing this because:

- You take time to reflect on what has gone well and what could be improved in your research practice
- You’ve benchmarked your skill levels in our capability framework, and are using it to identify development opportunities
- You regularly make time to learn new skills
- You regularly attend user research community of practise meetups and events, 
- You are a member of one of the UR community working groups or interest groups, helping to develop our user research maturity and capability
- You have, and are, a mentor, coach, buddy or profession manager
- You have talked or presented at UR community or other showcases, about insights you’ve uncovered, or methods and ways of working you’ve used 
- You sit on recruitment panels
- You are a service assessor, or are working towards being one


Right now, we help you to do this by giving you:

- National and local User Research Community meet-ups 
- Working groups and interest groups
- Community Slack channels
- Access for civil servant URs to profession management and buddying
- User Research Capability Framework, to help you benchmark your performance and identify development gaps
- Access to department-wide show and tells to showcase your work (Show The Thing)
- Guidance for UR service assessors (in the service assessment manual)
- Support for sitting on recruitment panels

In the future (see our profession roadmap), we’ll also give you:

- Capability-based pay for all civil servant URs
- Management in-profession for all civil servant URs
- Training and support for UR service assessors
- Consistent job descriptions for all UR roles across the Department
- In-house training programme and calendar of training events
- A list of recommended external training
- A common onboarding experience for all user researchers across the department
- Common job descriptions and a recruitment toolkit to ensure all civil servant user researchers are interviewed and recruited consistently
- Career-switch training programme for existing civil servants to move into UR
