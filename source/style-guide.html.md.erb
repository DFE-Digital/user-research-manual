# Content style

We speak to the reader ("you should" not "user researchers should")

We don’t repeat what DfE is saying elsewhere (e.g. link to a relevant page on the intranet, rather than repeating or paraphrasing it)

We don't simply repeat or paraphrase GOV.UK content, we link to it - unless we’re adding extra context or information (while linking to the original GOV.UK content)

If content is still in development or in beta, we clearly state this

We open all links in the same browser tab (i.e. don’t use target=“_blank”) except for opening Slack channels and otherwise taking users out of the browser.

'Particpants' or 'research particpants', not 'users'

We follow the GDS content style guide
