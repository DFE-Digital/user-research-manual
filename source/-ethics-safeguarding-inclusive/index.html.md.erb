# Ethics, safeguarding and inclusive research guidance

As a community of practice, and working with other teams in the Department, we have developed ethical and safeguarding guidance to make sure our research is respectful, inclusive and does not cause harm to our users, our teams, and ourselves.

Working to consistent principles and guidelines enables us to deliver joined-up, effective, targeted and trusted research that helps our teams deliver better services to our users.

As a user researcher at DfE, you should always follow the guidance set out in these pages. You should also get feedback on your research plans, and after your research is complete.

## What next?

This guidance will develop into a set of DfE user research standards. It is important that you regularly check for any modifications or updates to this section.
