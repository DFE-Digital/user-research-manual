# Using third-party research labs

Much of Department for Education's research is run contextually, in person in schools, colleges, etc, or is performed remotely. Because of this, we don't have any user research labs in DfE buildings, and we don't currently plan to build any.

However, you may sometimes have a valid research need to perform research in a specialist user research lab. This might be so that more of your team can attend research, or because it's not possible or approproate to visit users in their homes or workplaces, or because you want to use specialist tools like eyetracking.

Speak to your delivery manager, who can support you to find a lab on Digital Marketplace and book it.
