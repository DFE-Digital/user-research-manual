# How we're developing our user research profession

We want Department for Education to be the best place to do user research in government. We're constantly developing our profession: learning from best practice, introducing standards, guidance and support, and maturing how the department thinks about user research.

It's important to us that we work in the open. <a href="https://lucid.app/lucidspark/ffec378d-e50b-4a66-be6f-8b761da964d0/view">You can see what we're working on right now in our profession backlog, viewable by anybody.</a>

In summer 2022, we introduced a roadmap to develop our profession across DfE over the next few years. Our goal is to be truly joined-up and user-centred in the way we think about, plan and deliver our research, which means we will play our part in <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/lvewp00259/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC3452062-2EDE-4C09-9151-6F87A403F459%7D&file=20220110%20Digital%20and%20Data%20Strategy.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&cid=ad313829-fb7c-40f6-bda3-c88216285a76" target="_blank">reaching Mission 3 in the Department for Education DDaT (Digital, Data and Technology) strategy DDaT strategy (link opens in a new window, DfE intranet users only)</a> ("The DfE is a trusted, user-centred provider of joined up, targeted and effective policies and services").

There are 4 milestones in our roadmap:

1. <strong>Basic needs</strong>
    * Over the next few months, we will ensure that URs have the basic things they need to deliver user research, and to stay safe. (This website is a key part of us achieving this milestone.)

2. <strong>Standards-led</strong>
    * By the end of 2023, all URs are delivering the highest quality work, to a single, shared set of professional standards

3. <strong>Adaptive</strong>
    * By the end of 2025, mature, adaptive, experimentation-led research frameworks are in place for policy design, service design, and live service optimisation

4. <strong>Joined up and user-centred</strong>
    * By the end of the decade, we have a common, shared understanding of all our users, and research activity is joined up across the department, helping DfE meet Mission 3 of our DDaT strategy ("The DfE is a trusted, user-centred provider of joined up, targeted and effective policies and services")
