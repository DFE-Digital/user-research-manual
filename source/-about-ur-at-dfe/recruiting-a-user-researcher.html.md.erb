# Recruiting a user researcher for your team

<blockquote>
<p>Department for Education user research job vacancies are advertised on <a href="https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/">Civil Service Jobs</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

It is very important when we recruit civil servant user researchers into DfE, or promote people into new roles, that we are consistent in the way we describe and advertise the role, and how we assess them in their application and interview.

Using the job descriptions, guidance and support on this page will ensure that we do this.

[General guidance for recruiting roles](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/human-resources/SitePages/Jobs-and-recruitment.aspx) is on the DfE intranet.

## User researcher roles, grades and job descriptions

Our role names and job descriptions are based on the [standard UK government DDaT (Digital, Data and Technology) user research roles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/user-researcher), as described on GOV.UK, with some changes. This ensures that our roles are specific enough for our needs at DfE, but are also common with other user research roles in government. 

You __must__ always recruit a user researcher using the following job titles, grades and job description. If you use a different role title, grade or job description, your role may be refused. In the worst case, you may employ somebody at the wrong role for their level of capability, putting them and your project at risk. 

There is space in the job descriptions for you to add details about your team and business area. Don't make any further changes without first speaking to a [lead user research or the head of user research](people.html#user-research-leadership-team).

| __Role title__ | __Grade__ | __Job description template__ |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Junior user researcher | HEO | [Junior user researcher job description](https://dfe-digital.github.io/dfe-job-descriptions/user_research/junior_user_researcher/index.html) |
| User researcher | SEO | [User researcher job description](https://dfe-digital.github.io/dfe-job-descriptions/user_research/user_researcher/index.html) |
| Senior user researcher | G7 | [Senior user researcher job description](https://dfe-digital.github.io/dfe-job-descriptions/user_research/senior_user_researcher/index.html) |
| Lead user researcher | G6 | [Lead user researcher job description](https://dfe-digital.github.io/dfe-job-descriptions/user_research/lead_user_researcher/index.html#about-the-job) |
| Head of user research | G6 | (currently in development) |

Note that unlike some departments, we have a single ‘head of user research’ role. If you are recruiting a Grade 6 into your business area, you must always advertise and recruit this as a ‘lead user researcher’.

If you are recruiting a lead user researcher (G6), the head of user research must be involved in planning this role and your campaign.

## Assessing candidates at application

When you assess the applications for your role (known as the ‘sift’) you must assess against every essential skill listed in the job description.

## Interview questions and tasks 

We are developing an interview pack builder tool, with suggested interview formats, template interview scripts, a bank of questions and tasks for all roles, and examples of what good answers and weak answers might contain. This is currently in private beta testing.

This tool is currently in private beta for Senior (G7) roles: contact Tom Adams to get access to it.

When this tool is live, using it will ensure consistency in how we interview applicants, and will also save you time and effort when planning your interview.

We use the ‘experience’ [civil service success profile](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/success-profiles) in our interviews for all roles.

### Interview format for junior user researchers

For junior user researchers, we suggest a one hour interview with a task and 3 interview questions.

Each question should cover one of the three essential criteria. The task could focus on one criteria, or you could use it as an opportunity to additionally assess against all the essential criteria. 

For a junior role, it is important that you are assessing the candidate’s potential: they may not have extensive user research experience, but they may have relevant and transferrable skills and experience.

### Interview format for user researchers, senior user researchers and lead user researchers

For user researchers, senior user researchers and lead user researchers, we suggest a 90 minute interview, with a task and 4 interview questions.

Each interview question should cover one of the essential criteria. You should always include questions covering the top two criteria (Research methods and planning, and Analysis and synthesis).

The other two questions should be on the criteria that you think are most important/relevant to your specific role and business area (e.g. if you have a lot of ethically tricky research, you might decide to ask a question around the Ethics and safeguarding essential criteria). 

The task will generally ask candidates to give their approach to a hypothetical research situation, which you could use to additionally assess all criteria, or to focus on one or two that are particularly important to your role.

### Giving feedback to candidates after interviews

You should always give candidates constructive feedback alongside their interview scores: be respectful of their time and interest in DfE.

Consider offering them a call to give them more in-depth feedback. Candidates who were unsuccessful want to understand where they need to improve or develop, and for successful candidates this will demonstrate a commitment to their professional development before they enter the department, or move into your business area.
