# Our people

We have a large user research community, made up of civil servant and contractor user researchers, working across a number of different portfolio areas and user groups. The profession is led by our user research leadrship team.

## Find a user researcher in DfE

We keep a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLeXrIUQw--Z7cJxT6IVl1mrGhoupisGEN6csaCVxS8/edit#gid=887617174">list of all user researchers currently working across the department</a>, available to view and edit by anybody with a DfE email address.

## User research leadership team

Tom Adams is the <strong>head of profession for user research</strong> at Department for Education. 

Tom's job is to develop our professional capability across the department, by putting in place systems, frameworks, guidance and processes. Tom owns and is responsible for delivering our <a href="developing-ur-profession.html">profession strategy and roadmap.</a>

He advocates for user research in the department, and also joins up with other heads of user research to do this across government.

Some of our portoflio areas have <strong>lead user researchers</strong>, who coordinate research and manage the user research team in a single area of DfE. They are responsible for ensuring their user researchers are meeting our professional standards, and that they are coming together to share their insight and build up a single user-centered picture of our different user groups.

(Our goal is to have a Lead User Researcher in place in every portoflio of work in DfE. We're working on this.)

## User Research Operations

We have a small User Research Operations team (normally called Research Ops or ReOps). 

Research Ops support the Head of user research to develop services and guidance to help user researchers. Examples are our GDPR/data management framework, access to our departmental research library, and support with accessing our central participant recruitment supplier.

Our aim is to grow the Research Ops team to do things like developing a central participant recruitment panel, providing a full recruitment service to all user researchers, and support with insight management.
