# Our people

We have a large user research community, made up of civil servant and contractor user researchers, working across a number of different portfolio areas and user groups. 

## Find a user researcher in DfE

We keep a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLeXrIUQw--Z7cJxT6IVl1mrGhoupisGEN6csaCVxS8/edit#gid=887617174" target="_blank">list of all user researchers currently working across the department (opens in a new window)</a>, available to view and edit by anybody with a DfE email address.

## Head of user research

<strong>Tom Adams</strong> is the Head of Profession for user research at DfE. 

His job is to develop our professional capability by putting in place the systems, frameworks, guidance and processes to ensure that:
- we have consistent and well-understood ways of working, professional standards, and assurance processes
- we have the right tools and templates to do our jobs
- user research is understood, and teams and portfolios are creating working environments for user researchers to flourish in
- civil servant user researchers are able to develop their careers
- we come together as one DfE communnity of user researchers, to support and learn from each other
- we are delivering impactful research across the department that is helping DfE create better servcies and outcomes for our users

He advocates for user research in the department, and also joins up with other heads of user research to do this across government.

Tom is based in Manchester. He's keen to meet all of our user researchers - contact him on Slack or Teams, or put an introductory meeting in his Outlook calendar.

## Lead user researchers

Our goal is to have a Lead User Researcher in place in every portoflio of work in DfE. We're working on this.

Currently, we have three Leads:

- <strong>Annaliese Lamb</strong> - Lead User Researcher for Schools
    - <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/team/U035FP68FPB" target="_blank">Contact Annaliese in DfE Slack (opens a new window)</a>
    - Annaliese is based in Manchester
- <strong>Will Finn</strong> - Lead User Researcher for Teachers
    - <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/team/U0360NUT6PJ" target="_blank">Contact Will in DfE Slack (opens a new window)</a>
    - Will is based in Sheffield
- <strong>Claire Brickell</strong> - Lead User Researcher for Children and Families
    - Claire is currently away from DfE, due back in summer 2023

Lead user researchers coordinate research and manage the user research team in a single area of DfE. They are responsible for ensuring their user researchers are meeting our professional standards, and that they are coming together to share their insight and build up a single user-centered picture of our different user groups.

They are part of the leadership team in their portfolio, helping build good environments for research, and ensuring that user research and user insight are heard in the overall portfolio product strategy.

They also work closely with the Head of user research to develop user research capability across DfE, ensuring we have consistency across our portfolios, and that everybody gets the chance to learn from best practice in their areas.

## User Research Operations

We have a small User Research Operations team (normally called Research Ops or ReOps). 

Research Ops support the Head of user research to develop services and guidance to help user researchers. Examples are our GDPR/data management framework, access to our departmental research library, and support with accessing our central particpant recruitment supplier.

Our aim is to grow the Research Ops team to do things like developing a central participant recruitment panel, providing a full recruitment service to all user researchers, and support with insight management.

Currently the team is:

- <strong>Alice Kiernan</strong> - Research Ops Lead
