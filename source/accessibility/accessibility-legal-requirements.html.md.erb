# Accessibility legal requirements

To find out about the legal requirements you need to meet, check the [guidance on the GDS Service Manual for making your service accessible](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction).


## Make sure your service is accessible

Almost a fifth of working age adults in the UK have a disability, and approximately a quarter of people in the UK will experience a mental health problem each year. You need to make sure everyone’s needs are considered when building a service.

All DfE’s services must:

* be accessible to disabled people
* have an accessibility statement that says which parts of its digital content aren’t accessible and why
* have a way for people to tell the department if they find something that isn’t accessible
* have details of the official enforcement procedure if users want to make a complaint 

The Cabinet Office and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission monitor DfE services and investigate any breaches to the rules. There will be legal implications if the department is found to be breaking the law.
